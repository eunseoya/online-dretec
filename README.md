# dretec online timer

This project is an interactive, web-based timer and stopwatch inspired by Dretec's physical timers. The main feature is a visually rich, 3D timer interface built with React and Three.js, providing an experience similar to using a real Dretec timer.

## Features

- **3D Timer UI**: Realistic timer interface rendered with Three.js, including buttons, display, and indicator lights.
- **Multiple Modes**: Switch between clock, countdown timer, and stopwatch (with h:m:s and ms formats).
- **Session Logging**: Log completed timer/stopwatch sessions, view history, and clear or remove individual logs.
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on both desktop and mobile browsers.
- **Customizable**: Easily extendable for new features or timer types.

## Usage

1. **Timer/Stopwatch**: Use the 3D interface to set time, start/stop, and reset. The display updates in real time.
2. **Mode Switching**: Use the mode buttons to toggle between clock, timer, and stopwatch.
3. **Logging**: After a session, log the result for later review. View your session history in the app.

## Technologies

- **React**: UI framework for building the app.
- **Three.js**: 3D rendering for the timer interface.
- **Next.js**: App framework for routing and server-side rendering.
- **Context API**: For session and state management.
